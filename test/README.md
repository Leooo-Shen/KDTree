# Test

This is the folder for test function.

* `test_function.cpp`: it tests the functions of the code and prove validaty, by comparing results with pre-defined data. Tested functions include: construct_tree, find_minimum. 

* `test_performance.cpp`: it tests the time cost of the code with three different sizes of generated pesudo data that can be found in the `data` folder. 

* `test_tree.JPG`: a jpg picture of a kd-tree example. We compare it with the constructed tree in `test_function.cpp` to verify the correctness of construct_tree.
